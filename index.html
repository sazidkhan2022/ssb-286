<center><h2>Online Class</h2></center>
<p>There are two types of classes - Traditional face-to-face class and Online class.<br> If we compare both, the traditional classes are better than online classes in many ways.<br> First, in the traditional classes, a personal attention can be given to the particular student whereas it is not possible in online classes because learner has to learn by himself/herself.<br> Learning in a class with same age group is fun and interesting thing for the students.<br> It is also helpful in memorizing which is possible only in a traditional class.<br> Whereas there are no such types of interactive groups in online classes.<br> This can lead to monotonousness.<br> In online classes, computer or mobile may affect our eye sight but there is no such harm in traditional classes. <br>In traditional classes, moral values are taught whereas in online classes, the importance is given only to curriculum.<br> In traditional class, every doubt of a child can be cleared whereas it is not possible in online classes. Traditional classes can clear the concept of a child in a manner which he/she understands but for online classes, the content is fixed and cannot be changed according to the learnersâ€™ ability.</p>
